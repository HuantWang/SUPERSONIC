SuperSonic, a new open-source framework to allow compiler developers to integrate
RL into compilers easily, regardless of their RL expertise. SuperSonic supports
customizable RL architecture compositions to target a wide range of optimization
tasks.A key feature of SuperSonic is the use of deep RL and multi-task learning
techniques to develop a metaoptimizer to automatically find and tune the right RL
architecture from training benchmarks. It uses the `CompilerGym <https://compilergym.com/>`_,
`OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`_, `Ray <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/>`_ and
`OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`_
interfaces to expose reinforcement learning.

Key Concepts
------------

Supersonic enables developers to express the optimization space. It automatically
searches for the optimal RL policy, and provides an automated RL servicing
environment.

The ingredients for reinforcement learning that CompilerGym provides are:

* **Task Definition**:
The user-defined client RL search space typically includes candidate functions
(or models) for representing the environment state, objective
functions for computing the reward, and the set of possible actions that can be
taken from a given state. This search space definition can optionally include a
chosen set of RL exploration algorithms and transition functions to be used by a
client RL algorithm. Furthermore, the compiler engineer also needs to provide a
run function, which provides the measurement of an action to compute the reward.

* **Client RL search**:
Given a client RL search space, the SuperSonic meta-optimizer automatically finds a suitable client RL architecture (i.e.,
<state function, transition function, reward function, RL
algorithm> and potentially a value function) from training benchmarks
using up to ùëõ trial runs.

* **Client RL Deployment**:
SuperSonic provides APIs to load and reuse the stored objects
to optimize any new program. To apply amtuned RL, SuperSonic
creates a session to apply a standard
RL loop to optimize the input program by using the chosen
RL exploration algorithms to select an action for a given
state. For example, the state could be a vector recording the
last ùëõ compiler options added into the compiler flags or a
DNN.


Our goal is to allow compiler developers to integrate RL
into compilers easily, regardless of their RL expertise.

Next Steps
----------

Now that you have got to grips with the compiler environment, take a browse
through the `examples directory
<https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/tree/stable/examples>`_ for
pytorch integration, agent implementations, etc. Then check out `the
leaderboards <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym#leaderboards>`_ to
see what the best performing algorithms are, and `the documentation
<https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/>`_ for details of the APIs and
environments. We love feedback, bug reports, and feature requests - please `file
an issue <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/issues/new/choose>`_!
